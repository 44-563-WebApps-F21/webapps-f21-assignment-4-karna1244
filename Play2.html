    <h4 class="LORDWINDERMERE">LORD WINDERMERE</h4><p class="speech">I am sorry now I did not tell my wife the whole thing
     at once.</p><br>

   <h4 class="ERLYNNE">MRS.ERLYNNE</h4><p class="speech">I regret my bad actions.  You regret your good ones—that
   is the difference between us.</p></br>

   <h4 class="LORDWINDERMERE">LORD WINDERMERE</h4><p class="speech">I don’t trust you.  I _will_ tell my wife.  It’s better
   for her to know, and from me.  It will cause her infinite pain—it will
   humiliate her terribly, but it’s right that she should know.</p><br>

   <h4 class="ERLYNNE">MRS.ERLYNNE</h4><p class="speech">You propose to tell her?</p><br>

   <h4 class="LORDWINDERMERE">LORD WINDERMERE</h4><p class="speech">I am going to tell her.</p><br>

  <h4 class="ERLYNNE">MRS.ERLYNNE</h4><p class="Stage direction">[_Going up to him_.]</p><p class="speech">If you do, I will make my name so
 infamous that it will mar every moment of her life.  It will ruin her,
 and make her wretched.  If you dare to tell her, there is no depth of
 degradation I will not sink to, no pit of shame I will not enter.  You
 shall not tell her—I forbid you.</p><br>
