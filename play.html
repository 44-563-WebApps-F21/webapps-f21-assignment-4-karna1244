<h4>Same as in Act I.</h4>
<p>Description:LADY WINDERMERE.  [_Lying on sofa_.]  How can I tell him?  I can’t tell
    him.  It would kill me.  I wonder what happened after I escaped from that
    horrible room.  Perhaps she told them the true reason of her being there,
    and the real meaning of that—fatal fan of mine.  Oh, if he knows—how can
    I look him in the face again?  He would never forgive me.  [_Touches
    bell_.]  How securely one thinks one lives—out of reach of temptation,
    sin, folly.  And then suddenly—Oh!  Life is terrible.  It rules us, we do
    not rule it.
    </p>

    <h4 class="ERLYNNE">MRS.ERLYNNE</h4><p class="speech">Why do you say that?</p><br>
    <h4 class="LORDWINDERMERE">LORD WINDERMERE</h4><p class="speech" >You made me get you an invitation to my wife’s ball.</p><br>
    
    <h4 class="ERLYNNE">MRS.ERLYNNE</h4><p class="speech" >For my daughter’s ball—yes.</p><br>
    
    <h4 class="LORDWINDERMERE">LORD WINDERMERE</h4><p class="speech">You came, and within an hour of your leaving the house
    you are found in a man’s rooms—you are disgraced before every one.</p><p class="stagedirection">
    [_Goes up stage C._]</p><br>
    
    <h4 class="ERLYNNE">MRS.ERLYNNE</h4><p class="speech">Yes.</p><br>
    
    <h4 class="LORDWINDERMERE">LORD WINDEREME</h4><p class="stagedirection">[_Turning round on her_.]</p><p class ="speech">Therefore I have a right to
    look upon you as what you are—a worthless, vicious woman.  I have the
    right to tell you never to enter this house, never to attempt to come
    near my wife</p><br>
    
    <h4 class="ERLYNNE">MRS.ERLYNNE</h4><p class="stagedirection">[_Coldly_.]</p><p class="speech">My daughter, you mean.</p><br>
    
    
    <h4 class="LORDWINDERMERE">LORD WINDERMERE</h4><p class="speech">have no right to claim her as your daughter.  You
    left her, abandoned her when she was but a child in the cradle, abandoned
    her for your lover, who abandoned you in turn.</p><br>
    
    <h4 class="ERLYNNE">MRS.ERLYNNE</h4><p class="stagedirection">[_Rising_.]</p><p class="speech">Do you count that to his credit, Lord
    Windermere—or to mine?</p><br>
    
    <h4 class="LORDWINDERMERE">LORD WINDERMERE</h4><p class="speech">To his, now that I know you.</p>
    
    <h4 class="ERLYNNE">MRS.ERLYNNE</h4><p class="speech">Take care—you had better be careful.</p>
    
    <h4 class="LORDWINDERMERE">LORD WINDERMERE</h4><P class="speech">Oh, I am not going to mince words for you.  I know you
    thoroughly.</P><br>
    
    <h4 class="ERLYNNE">MRS.ERLYNNE</h4><p class="stagedirection">[_Looks steadily at him_.]</p><p class="speech">I question that</p><br>   
    <h4 class="LORDWINDERMERE">LORD WINDERMERE</h4><p class="speech">I _do_ know you.  For twenty years of your life you
    lived without your child, without a thought of your child.  One day you
    read in the papers that she had married a rich man.  You saw your hideous
    chance.  You knew that to spare her the ignominy of learning that a woman
    like you was her mother, I would endure anything.  You began your
    blackmailing.</p><br>
    
    <h4 class="ERLYNNE">MRS.ERLYNNE</h4>.<P class="stagedirection">[her shoulders_.]</P><p class="speech">Don’t use ugly words,
    Windermere.  They are vulgar.  I saw my chance, it is true, and took it.</p><br>
    
    <h4 class="LORDWINDERMERE">LORD WINDERMERE</h4><P class="speech">Yes, you took it—and spoiled it all last night by being
    found out.</P><br>
    
    <h4 class="ERLYNNE">MRS.ERLYNNE</h4><p class="stagedirection">[_With a strange smile_.]</p><p class="speech">I spoiled
    it all last night.</p><br>
    
    <h4 class="LORDWINDERMERE">LORD WINDERMERE</h4><p class="speech">And as for your blunder in taking my wife’s fan from
    here and then leaving it about in Darlington’s rooms, it is unpardonable.
    I can’t bear the sight of it now.  I shall never let my wife use it
    again.  The thing is soiled for me.  You should have kept it and not
    brought it back.</p><h4>
    
    <h4 class="ERLYNNE">MRS.ERLYNNE</h4><p class="speech">I think I shall keep it.</p><p class="stagedirection">[_Goes up_.]</p><p class="speech">It’s extremely
    pretty</p><p class="stage direction">[_Takes up fan_.]</p><p class="speech">I shall ask Margaret to give it to me</p><br>
    
    <h4 class="LORDWINDERMERE">LORDWINDERMERE</h4><p class="speech">I hope my wife will give it you.</p><br>
    
    <h4 class="ERLYNNE">MRS.ERLYNNE</h4><p class="speech">Oh, I’m sure she will have no objection</p><br>
